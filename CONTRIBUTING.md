# Contributing to the Media Standards Registry (MSR)

Thanks for your interest in helping improve the Media Standards Registry!  
MSR is a living, automated dataset that maps relationships across standards documents from SMPTE, ISO, ITU, AES, and others.

## How the System Works
MSR runs a fully automated pipeline of GitHub Actions that:
1. Extracts and validates structured document metadata (`extract-docs.yml`)
2. Builds indices for suites (MSI) and references (MRI)
3. Publishes to the live site ([mediastandardsregistry.org](https://mediastandardsregistry.org))
4. Validates URLs weekly

Changes to data or logic will typically trigger part of this chain automatically.

## Ways You Can Contribute
- **Data improvements** — fix or add metadata in `src/main/data/documents.json`
- **Extraction logic** — enhance parsers in `src/main/scripts/extractDocs.js`
- **Validation** — improve URL checks or logic in `src/main/scripts/url.validate.js`
- **Documentation** — improve clarity in `README.md` or `samples.md`
- **Testing** — help identify edge cases or create fixtures under `/test/`

## Development Setup
1. Install **Node.js 20+** and npm.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SteveLLamb/mediastandards-registry.git
   cd mediastandards-registry
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
4. Run scripts as needed:
    ```bash
    npm run extract
    npm run build-msi
    npm run build-mri
    npm run validate-urls
    npm run normalize-urls
    npm run canonicalize
    npm run validate
    npm run build

##  Submitting Changes
-	Open a pull request from a feature branch (feature/<name>).
-	Include a short, clear description of what was changed.
-	For large or structural edits, please open a discussion issue first.
-	If your change affects automation, reference the workflow (.yml) it touches.

Note: Most automated PRs are generated by CI workflows.
Manual PRs should avoid conflicting with ongoing automation runs.

##  Data and Provenance
When contributing or editing document metadata:
- Use consistent schema fields [(src/main/schemas/document.schema.json)](src/main/schemas/document.schema.json)
- Ensure `$meta` provenance fields are properly maintained:
  - source, confidence, updated, overridden, etc.
- Avoid manual edits to `resolvedHref` — these are maintained by automation.
