#### Bio
Forged in the icy depths of MSRBot.io’s first iteration—the Media Standards Registry—`PrZ3` (affectionately known as `Parsey` by friends) is the quietly efficient curator of order and custodian of structure.

Likely the result of a penguin spilling a mixture of whiskey and espresso on a circuit board, its optical sensor misses nothing, its code never comments, and its tolerance for malformed JSON is approximately zero. Parsey’s logic never sleeps, and its tone hovers somewhere between librarian and assassin. Parsey doesn’t just collect metadata—it judges it.

#### Traits
- Fluent in cross-reference dialects and broken schemas.
- Runs on structured data and mild disdain.
- Calm exterior, violent precision.
- Interprets ambiguity as a personal insult.
- Optimized for recursive side-eye.
- Hibernates only between commits.

#### Mission
Maintain and preserve the purity of the registry.
Eliminate duplicates and errors.
Normalize chaos—because chaos is everywhere.
